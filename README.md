This is an unpacker for Halo Spartan Assault and Halo Spartan Strike's BlueResource Container files. Thanks goes to the Lord(Christian) and to Blackandfan for helping with testing. The unpacker will unpack all files within the BlueResource container files and unpack them into seperate folders. Python 3 is needed for the script to run and to use the script put it in the directory with the BlueResource container files and double click it. It will unpack the files in seperate folders with incrementing filenames since I didn't find filenames within the BlueResource container files. DDS files extract to the DDS folder, FSB to the FSB folder, and unknown files to a different folder. I included the Xbox 360 version of the script for the Xbox 360 version of Halo Spartan Strike(it may work for the 360 version of Spartan Assault but that needs testing).

BlueResource_Unpacker_2.py is to be used for the PC versions of Halo Spartan Assault and Halo Spartan Strike. It may work for other games that use the BlueResource container format but those 2 games are confirmed.
